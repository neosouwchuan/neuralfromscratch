# neuralfromscratch
My JC1 one shot attempt at writing a neural network from scratch except for using only pytorch tensor multiplication for speed reasons
All code needed is contained within the ipynb file.
This code is written within 5 days for my own understanding, and therefore will not be maintained, not that it could compete with torch anyways.
Also most of the math was learnt from the book Deep Learning by John D Kelleher, its a great book.
